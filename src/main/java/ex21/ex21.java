//Many programs display information to the end user in one form but use a different form inside the program. For example, you may show the word Blue on the screen, but behind the scenes youâ€™ll have a numerical value for that color or an internal value because you may need to represent the textual description in another language for Spanish-speaking visitors.
//
//Write a program that converts a number from 1 to 12 to the corresponding month. Prompt for a number and display the corresponding calendar month, with 1 being January and 12 being December. For any value outside that range, display an appropriate error message.
//
//Example Output
//Please enter the number of the month: 3
//The name of the month is March.
//Constraints
//Use a switch or case statement for this program.
//Use a single output statement for this program.
